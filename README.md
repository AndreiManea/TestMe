# TestMe
<p> My bachelor thesis that consist in a <strong>web platform</strong> that I developed using the <strong>MEAN</strong> stack.</p>
<p> An application that has 2 different user types, teacher and student. </p> </br>
<p>The teacher has the ability to create tests and evaluate students using the tests he/she created. </p>
<p>The student has the ability to take a test based on a code the teacher provided ( the code is chosen during the creation of a test ). </p>
<p>Both user types have the ability to view results ( the teachers can view results of how students performed on their tests, the students have a history of the tests they took with results ). </p><br/>   
<p><strong>CRUD functionality</strong> is implemented for the creation of tests.</p>
<p>User <strong>authentification</strong> and <strong>authorization</strong> is implemented. </p>
<p><strong>Error handling</strong> is implemented for every situation. </p>
<p><strong>Mobile responsive</strong>. </p>
