# TestMe
My bachelor thesis that consist in a web platform that I developed using the MEAN stack.
An application that has 2 different user types, teacher and student.
The teacher has the ability to create tests and evaluate students using the tests he/she created.
The student has the ability to take a test based on a code the teacher provided ( the code is chosen during the creation of a test ).
Both user types have the ability to view results ( the teachers can view results of how students performed on their tests, the students have a history of the tests they took with results).   
CRUD functionality is implemented for the creation of tests.
Error handling is implemented for every situation.
Mobile responsive.
