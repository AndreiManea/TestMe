# TestMe
My bachelor thesis that consist in a <strong>web platform</strong> that I developed using the <strong>MEAN</strong> stack. <br/>
An application that has 2 different user types, teacher and student. <br/><br/>
The teacher has the ability to create tests and evaluate students using the tests he/she created. <br/>
The student has the ability to take a test based on a code the teacher provided ( the code is chosen during the creation of a test ). <br/>
Both user types have the ability to view results ( the teachers can view results of how students performed on their tests, the students have a history of the tests they took with results ). <br/><br/>   
<strong>CRUD functionality</strong> is implemented for the creation of tests. <br/>
User <strong>authentification</strong> and <strong>authorization</strong> is implemented.  <br/>
<strong>Error handling</strong> is implemented for every situation. <br/>
<strong>Mobile responsive</strong>. <br/>
